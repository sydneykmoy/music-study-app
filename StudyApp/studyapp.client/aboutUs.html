        <h2>This app is meant to help you study better. It works in tandem with Spotify to record data about your study sessions and gives you feedback on how you can improve your productivity. 
        The way it works is that you sign up for a Pixela account and we use their API to show you your productivity for each study session in an easy to read graph form. 
        You also need to sign in with your Spotify account so that we can access the music you're listening to in order to process it and give you feedback on what the most productive genre of music for YOU personally is.
        Each study session is automatically saved and your music history/productivity for the day will be easily accessed through our Past Study Session page.</h2>
